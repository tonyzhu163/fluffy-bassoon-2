# CTM in-context RL: coordination

Live coordination for `fluffy-bassoon-2`, updated **2026-10-31 Asia/Shanghai**.
Keep current decisions and jobs here, method contracts in `docs/`, verified
results in `EVALUATION.md`, and dated plans and evidence in
`outputs/<run-id>/`. Follow [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and the
[retention policy](../README.md#artifact-retention).

Earlier state, including the fallback ideas, run order, DSRL how-to, CMM
calibration table and completed 2026-10-28/29 jobs, is in the
[2026-10-31 snapshot](archive/coordination/coordination-20261031.md). The
[cutover placeholder](archive/coordination/coordination-pre-cutover-20261028.md)
and [source-repository records](https://github.com/tonyzhu163/fluffy-bassoon/blob/lycoreco_rl/outputs/coordination.md)
are older.

## Question and decision

Can a persistent CTM learn from interaction history with fixed deployment
weights, and does its recurrence offer an advantage over conventional memory?
Separate architecture performance from motor competence, steering headroom,
informative history and optimization.

- If XL adapts and CTM does not, retain the qualified pipeline and use the
  stronger learner while revising the CTM claim.
- If neither adapts, diagnose the interface, histories and training signal
  before attributing failure to memory.
- Judge adaptation with paired fresh probes, trained static/reset controls
  and valid history interventions.

Contracts: [support/probe](../docs/ctm-support-probe.md),
[feature bridge](../docs/pi05-feature-bridge.md),
[PPO replay](../docs/pi05-bridge-policy.md).
Results: [meta-RL evaluation](../src/fluffy_bassoon/meta_rl/EVALUATION.md).

### Redesign (2026-10-31)

No robot comparison so far shows memory or adaptation. The governing plan is
the [frozen pi0.5 steering screen](frozen-pi05-steering-screen-20261031-r1/PLAN.md):
first show a controller can improve the frozen motor on cases it fails, then
show experience changes a useful later decision. The
[steering-headroom audit](steering-headroom-audit-20261031-r1/AUDIT.md) gives
the paired fixed100 evidence. The earlier
[headroom diagnosis](archive/icrl-headroom-diagnosis-20261031-r1/PLAN.md) is
archived as superseded, with corrections listed at its top. A
[criteria proposal](steering-interface-criteria-20261031-r1/PROPOSAL.md)
informs the newly authorized [targeted scope](frozen-pi05-endtoend-20261031-r1/SCOPE.json),
which adopts A1/A2/A3 with the [review safeguards](frozen-pi05-steering-screen-20261031-r1/CRITERIA-REVIEW.md).
The proposal is not adopted verbatim: search is explicitly bounded, improvement
must be measured rather than assumed, and the initial mechanism panel does not
replace fresh32-case confirmation before broader claims.

## Coordination rules in force

From the [2026-10-31 review](archive/coordination/coordination-20261031.md#coordination-review-2026-10-31):

- Push coordination edits to `main`, rebased, editing only your own row.
  Branch-only edits leave this file stale.
- One or two readable sentences per row: job ID, last check, progress, next
  action and a link. Put hashes, byte counts and budget ledgers in the
  linked run record.
- Budget: roughly **1M source actions per learner** (human, 2026-10-30;
  confirmed 2026-10-31), superseding "1M per benchmark, shared". Charge each
  learner's actions to its own ledger; do not borrow across learners or
  benchmarks.
- Baseline priority (human, 2026-10-31): same-motor DSRL/SAC first, native
  VLRLA PPO afterward. `frozen-vla-poc` (`finish_assembly`/`finish_ppo`) is
  the sole LIBERO launcher; RoboTwin AD GPU work stays deferred.
- Active `codex/*` branches were merged into `main` on 2026-10-31; merge
  further verified work promptly (see [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)).

Rows are as last recorded by their owners; none was re-queried for this
update.

### Needs owner refresh

Last recorded 2026-10-28 19:23 Shanghai; state since then unknown. Owners:
confirm terminal state and move each to completed work.

- RoboTwin GRPO learning gate, Baige `job-vh9lp7fvgf9n`: initializing, one
  GPU / 20-minute cap.
- MetaWorld bounded pilot r2, Baige `job-x2x4kdpfn011`: first evaluation
  saved, one GPU / 180-minute cap.
- CMM decay diagnostics thu2 48983/48984: last recorded queued. The packed
  diagnostic 49178 below covers the same comparison; confirm these were
  cancelled.

## Recently completed work

Details for each are in the [snapshot](archive/coordination/coordination-20261031.md).

- **CMM calibration**, thu2 48876: complete, failed (4.55% vs paper 30.63%);
  optimization instability. Packed decay diagnostic thu2 49178: no clear
  speedup. CMM structure tests stay gated on calibration.
- **DSRL Stage 0 smoke**, Baige `job-gjkse1sb5gyj`: repeat determinism failed
  (4/32 identical trajectories); S0b/S0c not run.
- **Native-context pilot r3**, Baige `job-8kkjhb65px67`: failed feedback
  validation, exit 1; preserved.
- **Native pi0.5 CTM/XL PPO, support/probe gate, privileged tracker**:
  complete and audited 2026-10-28; no ICRL or architecture claim.
- **Cached CTM/XL/GTrXL, CMM cached screen, DPT warm starts**: complete; one
  cached seed, no CTM advantage.
- **Baige environment cleanup**: complete 2026-10-29.
